## [easy] challenge #1

create a program that will ask the users name, age, and reddit username. have it tell them the information back, in the format:

`your name is (blank), you are (blank) years old, and your username is (blank)`

for extra credit, have the program log this information in a file to be accessed later.

## [intermediate] challenge #1

create a program that will allow you to enter events organizable by hour. There must be menu options of some form, and you must be able to easily edit, add, and delete events without directly changing the source code.

(note that by menu i dont necessarily mean gui. as long as you can easily access the different options and receive prompts and instructions telling you how to use the program, it will probably be fine)

## [hard] challenge #1

we all know the classic "guessing game" with higher or lower prompts. lets do a role reversal; you create a program that will guess numbers between 1-100, and respond appropriately based on whether users say that the number is too high or too low. Try to make a program that can guess your number based on user input and great code!

## [easy] challenge #2

Hello, coders! An important part of programming is being able to apply your programs, so your challenge for today is to create a calculator application that has use in your life. It might be an interest calculator, or it might be something that you can use in the classroom. For example, if you were in physics class, you might want to make a F = M * A calc.

EXTRA CREDIT: make the calculator have multiple functions! Not only should it be able to calculate F = M * A, but also A = F/M, and M = F/A!

## [intermediate] challenge #2

create a short text adventure that will call the user by their name. The text adventure should use standard text adventure commands ("l, n, s, e, i, etc.").

for extra credit, make sure the program doesn't fault, quit, glitch, fail, or loop no matter what is put in, even empty text or spaces. These will be tested rigorously!

For super extra credit, code it in C

## [difficult] challenge #2

Your mission is to create a stopwatch program. this program should have start, stop, and lap options, and it should write out to a file to be viewed later.

## [easy] challenge #3

Welcome to cipher day!

write a program that can encrypt texts with an alphabetical caesar cipher. This cipher can ignore numbers, symbols, and whitespace.

for extra credit, add a "decrypt" function to your program!

## [intermediate] challenge #3

Welcome to cipher day!

Create a program that can take a piece of text and encrypt it with an alphabetical substitution cipher. This can ignore white space, numbers, and symbols.

for extra credit, make it encrypt whitespace, numbers, and symbols!

for extra extra credit, decode someone elses cipher!

## [difficult] challenge #3

Welcome to cipher day!

For this challenge, you need to write a program that will take the scrambled words from this post, and compare them against THIS WORD LIST to unscramble them. For bonus points, sort the words by length when you are finished. Post your programs and/or subroutines!

Here are your words to de-scramble:

mkeart

sleewa

edcudls

iragoge

usrlsle

nalraoci

nsdeuto

amrhat

inknsy

iferkna

## [easy] challenge #4

You're challenge for today is to create a random password generator!

For extra credit, allow the user to specify the amount of passwords to generate.

For even more extra credit, allow the user to specify the length of the strings he wants to generate!

## [intermediate] challenge #4

create a calculator program that will take an input, following normal calculator input (5*5+4) and give an answer (29). This calculator should use all four operators.

For extra credit, add other operators (6(4+3), 3 ** 3, etc.)

## [difficult] challenge #4

today, your challenge is to create a program that will take a series of numbers (5, 3, 15), and find how those numbers can add, subtract, multiply, or divide in various ways to relate to eachother. This string of numbers should result in 5 * 3 = 15, or 15 /3 = 5, or 15/5 = 3. When you are done, test your numbers with the following strings:

4, 2, 8

6, 2, 12

6, 2, 3

9, 12, 108

4, 16, 64

For extra credit, have the program list all possible combinations.

for even more extra credit, allow the program to deal with strings of greater than three numbers. For example, an input of (3, 5, 5, 3) would be 3 * 5 = 15, 15/5 = 3. When you are finished, test them with the following strings.

2, 4, 6, 3

1, 1, 2, 3

4, 4, 3, 4

8, 4, 3, 6

9, 3, 1, 7

## [intermediate] challenge #5

Your challenge today is to write a program that can find the amount of anagrams within a .txt file. For example, "snap" would be an anagram of "pans", and "skate" would be an anagram of "stake".
